They knew as little of you as you did of them; this would have been the reason for their keeping aloof from you as well, which you would have felt as a hardship. Learn never to conceive a prejudice against others because you know nothing of them. It is bad reasoning, and makes enemies of half the world. Do not think ill of them till they behave ill to you; and then strive to avoid the faults, which you see in them. This will disarm their hostility sooner than pique or resentment or complaint.</p>",

      "question": "<p>Age has a curvilinear relationship with the exploitation of opportunity. Initially, age will increase the likelihood that a person will exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity because people gather much of the knowledge necessary to exploit opportunities over the course of their lives, and because age provides credibility in transmitting that information to others. However, as people become older, their willingness to bear risks declines, their opportunity costs rise, and they become less receptive to new information. [CAT 2006]</p>",

Good maps pull out the most important features and throw away a huge amount of much less valuable information.

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "We must select that sentence that follows the line of thought presented in the passage.\nThe author talks about the question asked by the reporter to Federer. Federer says that he was the best player\nof his generation but not even close to all-time best. He says that compared to “some guys” he is a minnow. So,\nthe concluding line must be related to his answer.\nNow, let’s check each of the options. Agassi might not be one of the “some guys” that Federer referred to in his\nstatement and hence, the concluding sentence cannot be option A. Moreover, the win against Agassi does not\nprove that he is an all-time best tennis player. So, option A is wrong.\nOption B is clearly out of scope as Sampras was not mentioned anywhere in the given passage.\nOption C says that Federer is more than a minnow to his contemporaries. This sentence extends the idea given\nin the previous sentence and hence is in line with rest of the passage. Also, this line concludes the paragraph\nperfectly. Hence, sentence C could be the answer.\nOption D is definitely related to the paragraph, but is not related to the question posed by the reporter. Between\noptions C and D, option C fits better because it is more related to the question posed by the reporter and the\nanswer given by Federer.\nHence, option C is the answer.",

The ruler so inaugurated was regarded not as a temporal autocrat but as the instrument of protective and sheltering firmament of supreme law. The white umbrella symbol is of great antiquity and its varied use illustrates the ultimate common basis of non-theocratic nature of states in the Indian tradition.

The only stipulation is that researchers and businesses will have to register their modifications to plants or animals with the government, with the exception of microbes cultured in contained environments. Reactions to the decision are mixed. While lauding the potential benefits of genome editing, an editorial opposes across-the-board permission. Unforeseen risks in gene editing cannot be ruled out.

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Let us note down the important points:\nThe Japanese government recommends regulating GM organisms in which foreign genes are introduced, not\nthose in which the endogenous genes have been edited. The step has drawn mixed reactions since there are\nsome risks involved in gene editing.\nOption A shifts the focus on exempting microbes. The central theme of the passage is that endogenous gene\nediting is not totally risk free. Therefore, we can eliminate option A.\nOption B states that categorizing GM products advances science but defies laws. No such comparison has\nbeen made in the paragraph. The legality of the issue has not been discussed and hence, we can eliminate\noption B.\nOption D fails to capture the fact that endogenous gene editing is not devoid of risks.\nOnly option C captures the fact that exempting endogenous gene editing is not desirable due to the risks\ninvolved. Therefore, option C is the right answer.",

Also, peaceful co-existence implies that the Jews were tolerant as well, whereas the main focus of\nthe passage is on how India has been tolerant of the Jews.\nStatement B is accurate since it speaks of how Jews in India have never faced discrimination. From the term\n'religous tolerance' we can see that people belonging to a particular religion and not facing discrimination\nwould further the point of the passage.\nStatement D is out of context.\nStatement C is incorrect because it shifts the focus of the paragraph from the India being tolerant of Jews to\nJews being tolerant of India.\nStatement E is not in line with the overall theme and direction in which the para has been shaping up. It\ndisregards the point on religious tolerance.\n\n82. E\nB is not a proper concluding statement.\nD is contrary to the theme of the para.\nAmong A, C and E, E is the best concluding statement since it is very specific and talks about the 'origin of\nthought' and 'purity', which is keeping in line with the flow of the paragraph.\nHence, option E is the correct answer.\n\n83.

It also underscores that while language is unique to humans,\nit is not a standalone trait and incorporates elements beyond language-specific features.\nThe passage mentions that language is a complex bundle of traits that must have evolved over a significant\ntime frame. It also states that language draws on aspects of cognition that are long established in the primate\nlineage, such as memory. This suggests that language did not emerge in isolation but rather built upon\npreexisting cognitive capacities.\nMemory plays a crucial role in language, as language involves storing, retrieving, and processing linguistic\ninformation. Through the use of memory, individuals can learn and recall words, phrases, grammar rules, and\nother linguistic elements. Memory also allows for the retention and transmission of cultural knowledge and\nlanguage acquisition in individuals and across generations.\nTherefore, Option A accurately captures the notion that language evolved by incorporating linguistic features\nonto existing cognitive abilities, notably memory.\nOption B is partially correct as it acknowledges the evolution of language and its connection to memory.\nHowever, it does not capture the idea that language is a complex bundle of traits or the absence of definitive\nevidence for language in other species.\nWhile Option C captures the idea that language is not a single, uniform entity, it fails to encompass the\ncomplete message of the passage. The passage emphasizes that language is more than just the end result of\nlinguistic evolution. It highlights that language also relies on cognitive features that are established in the\nprimate lineage, such as memory. Additionally, the passage mentions that there is no definitive evidence of\nlanguage in other species. These aspects are not adequately represented in option C.\nOption D is partially correct in stating that language is distinctively human. However, it fails to capture the\ncomplexity of language and the fact that it is a bundle of traits. It also overlooks the possibility that evidence for\nlanguage in other species may be inconclusive rather than entirely nonexistent.\nIn comparison to these options, Option A stands out as the best summary because it specifically addresses\nthe evolution of language and highlights the role of cognition, particularly memory, in its development.",
