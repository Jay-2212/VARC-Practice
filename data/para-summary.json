Gradually , life for the island’ s bir ds is improving. Antarctic prions and white-headed petrels, which also nest in burrows, had managed t o cling on in some sites while pests wer e on the island. Their numbers ar e now increasing. “It’ s fantastic and so exciting, ” Shaw sa ys. As bir ds return t o breed, the y also poo. This adds nutrients t o the soil, which in turn helps the plants t o grow back stronger . Tall plants then help burrowing bir ds hide fr om predatory skuas. “It’ s this wonder ful feedback loop, ” Shaw sa ys. Today, the “ pretty paddock” that Houghton first experienced has been transformed. “The tussock is o ver your head, and y ou’re dodging all these penguin tunnels, ” she sa ys.

John Cleese t old F ox News Digital that comedians do not ha ve the fr eedom t o be funny in 2022. “Ther e’s alwa ys been limitations on what the y’re allowed t o sa y,” Cleese said. “I think it’ s particularly worr ying at the moment because y ou can only cr eate in an atmospher e of fr eedom, wher e you’re not checking e verything y ou say critically befor e you mo ve on. What y ou ha ve to be able t o do is t o build without knowing wher e you’re going because y ou’ve never been ther e befor e. That’ s what cr eativity is — y ou ha ve to be allowed t o build. And a lot of comedians now ar e sitting ther e and when the y think of something, the y say something lik e, ‘Can I get awa y with it? I don ’t think so.

Years later , unemplo yed Charles Darr ow sold a simplied v ersion t o Parker Br others. They paid Magie only $500 for her patent—without r oyalties—and cr edited Darr ow as the sole inv entor.

      "explanation": "The passage describes how ageing, a weak er immune system, and chr onic disease ar e connected. It\nintroduces senescent or “z ombie ” cells, explains that y ounger people clear them mor e easily , and shows that\nthis pr ocess slows with age.

It corr ectly sa ys that senescent cells ar e malfunctioning and pr esent in the body , but it\nmisses the main point: as people age, these cells ar e not clear ed as well, the y build up, and this leads t o\ninammation.\nOption B  points out the diff erences between y ounger and older immune systems and mentions apopt osis, but it\nwrongly states that z ombie cells 'r esist' apopt osis. The passage actually focuses on the immune system\nbecoming less eff ectiv e, not the cells r esisting.

The passage is about metabolically activ e\nsenescent cells, not dead cells, and it does not sa y that inammation dir ectly weak ens the immune system as\nthis option suggests.\nSo, option C best sums up the main idea of the passage.",

      "explanation": "The passage talks about a k ey issue in modern ar t: a globalised world lets ar tists nd inspir ation in many\ncultur es, but this also brings the risk of cultur al appr opriation. The author explains that r espectful and\nthoughtful inspir ation can help people appr eciate other cultur es. On the other hand, cultur al appr opriation is not\njust borr owing, but borr owing without understanding, r espect, or acknowledgement, which can lead t o\ncommodication, ster eotypes, and bigger pr oblems in society , like reinfor cing power imbalances. Based on this,\nlet's consider each option individually .\nOption A clearly shows both sides of the ar gument. It mentions the global context, separ ates r espectful\ninspir ation fr om appr opriation that lacks acknowledgement, and highlights the passage ’s focus on bigger social\nissues lik e power imbalances. This matches the passage ’s main points well.\nOption B points out the main diff erence between r espectful inspir ation and appr opriation, but it is t oo gener al. It\ntreats the issue as just a matter of “ deciding” and lea ves out the eff ects of appr opriation and its impact on\nsociety , which ar e key par ts of the passage.\nOption C gets the author ’s view wr ong b y suggesting that dr awing fr om diff erent cultur es alwa ys “r esults in\ninstances of both inspir ation and cultur al appr opriation. ” The passage does not sa y this is ine vitable. Instead, it\nsays appr opriation depends on how the borr owing happens. Also, \" artists must  draw fr om div erse cultur al\ninuences \" is a bit str ong, and it is also not implied in the passage. \nOption D does a good job explaining the diff erence between inspir ation and appr opriation and talks about\ncommodication and ster eotypes. Howe ver, it does not mention the global context or the idea of wider power\nimbalances, so it is a bit mor e limited in scope compar ed to the passage.\nOverall, option A is the best choice because it co vers the global context, the ethical diff erence between\ninspir ation and appr opriation, and the wider social eff ects the author talks about. VIDEO SOLUTION\n VIEW SOLUTION",
