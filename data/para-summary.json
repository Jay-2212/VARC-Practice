      "question": "<p><strong>The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries. Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gradually, life for the island's birds is improving. Antarctic prions and white-headed petrels, which also nest in burrows, had managed to cling on in some sites while pests were on the island. Their numbers are now increasing. \"It's fantastic and so exciting,\" Shaw says. As birds return to breed, they also poo. This adds nutrients to the soil, which in turn helps the plants to grow back stronger. Tall plants then help burrowing birds hide from predatory skuas. \"It's this wonderful feedback loop,\" Shaw says. Today, the \"pretty paddock\" that Houghton first experienced has been transformed. \"The tussock is over your head, and you're dodging all these penguin tunnels,\" she says. The orchids and tiny herb that had been protected by fencing have started turning up all over the place.</p>",
      "options": [
        "There is an increasing number of predatory birds and plants on the island despite the presence of pests which is a positive development.",
        "In the absence of pests, life on the island is now protected, and there has been a revival of a variety of birds and plants.",
        "Flowering plants, herbs and birds are now being protected on this wonderful Antarctic island.",
        "There is a huge positive transformation of the ecosystem of the island when brought under environmental protection."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The passage describes how life on the island is gradually improving, particularly for birds like Antarctic prions\nand white-headed petrels. It highlights that these birds are increasing in numbers as pests are controlled on the\nisland. The absence of pests allows the birds to return, breed, and contribute to the ecosystem positively. The\npassage also mentions how bird droppings add nutrients to the soil, supporting plant growth. Overall, Option B\neffectively conveys the central theme of the passage - the revival and improvement of life on the island due to\nthe absence of pests and the positive impact on birds and plants.\nOption A incorrectly suggests an increase in the number of predatory birds, which contradicts the positive\ndevelopments mentioned in the passage.\nOption C is incorrect as the passage doesn't explicitly state that this protection is the primary cause of the\npositive changes.\nOption D is more general and doesn't specifically address the absence of pests as a crucial factor in the\npositive transformation mentioned in the passage.",

      "question": "<p><strong>The passage given below is followed by four alternate summaries. Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>John Cleese told Fox News Digital that comedians do not have the freedom to be funny in 2022. \"There's always been limitations on what they're allowed to say,\" Cleese said. \"I think it's particularly worrying at the moment because you can only create in an atmosphere of freedom, where you're not checking everything you say critically before you move on. What you have to be able to do is to build without knowing where you're going because you've never been there before. That's what creativity is — you have to be allowed to build. And a lot of comedians now are sitting there and when they think of something, they say something like, 'Can I get away with it? I don't think so. So and so got into trouble, and he said that, oh, she said that.' You see what I mean? And that's the death of creativity.\"</p>",
      "options": [
        "Comedians must not check what they think and say. They must go where no one has gone before.",

        "Freedom and creativity are essential for comedy. Fear about offending people hinders originality."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Option D best captures the essence of the passage.\nJohn Cleese argues that comedians need freedom to be creative and that fear of offending people or worrying\nabout the consequences of what they say hinders their ability to be original. He highlights how modern\ncomedians often second-guess themselves, which stifles their creativity. Option D reflects this idea, which\nstresses the importance of freedom and creativity in comedy, while warning against the fear that stifles\ninnovation.\nOption A: While Cleese advocates for freedom in comedy, he doesn't say that comedians \"must go where no\none has gone before,\" which is more of an extreme interpretation than the essence of the passage.\nOption B: This option focuses too much on the relationship between creativity and critical thinking. The\npassage is more about how fear of offending hinders creativity, not about creativity being incompatible with\ncritical thinking.\nOption C: This focuses on the \"death of the art form,\" but Cleese's main point is about how fear of\nrepercussions impacts creativity, not about the art form dying as such.",

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Certain codes may, of course, be so widely distributed in a specific language community or culture, and be learned at so early an age, that they appear not to be constructed - the effect of an articulation between sign and referent - but to be ‘naturally’ given. Simple visual signs appear to have achieved a ‘near-universality’ in this sense: though evidence remains that even apparently ‘natural’ visual codes are culture specific. However, this does not mean that no codes have intervened; rather, that the codes have been profoundly naturalized. The operation of naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and ‘naturalness’ of language but the depth, the habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use. They produce apparently ‘natural’ recognitions. This has the (ideological) effect of concealing the practices of coding which are present.</p>",
      "options": [
        "Learning linguistic and visual signs at an early age makes all such codes appear natural. This naturalization of codes is the effect of ideology.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Option C is the correct answer.\nThis option captures the main idea of the passage that some codes, like language and visual signs, are so\ncommonly used that they appear natural and conceal the process of how they were created.\nOption A: The passage does not suggest that early learning is why codes appear natural. The cause-and-effect\nrelationship is incorrectly stated here.\nOption B: This option misinterprets two key aspects of the passage. First, the idea that certain codes are \"made\nto appear universal\" is somewhat misleading because the passage doesn't claim that codes are deliberately\nmade universal; instead, it describes how codes, through habituation and widespread use, come to feel\n\"natural\". Second, the phrase \"Ideology aims to hide the mechanism of coding\" is not supported by the passage.\nThe passage suggests that the naturalization of codes leads to the illusion of transparency and naturalness,\nwhich conceals the mechanisms of coding, but it doesn't explicitly discuss ideology as a force that intentionally\nhides these mechanisms\nOption D: This option is incorrect because the passage doesn’t claim that all codes have a natural origin. It\nstates that codes become naturalized through use, not that they were naturally originating from the start.",

      "question": "<p>Although almost all climate scientists agree that the Earth is gradually warming, they have long been of two minds about the process of rapid climate shifts within larger periods of change. Some have speculated that the process works like a giant oven or freezer, warming or cooling the whole planet at the same time. Others think that shifts occur on opposing schedules in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, like exaggerated seasons. Recent research in Germany examining climate patterns in the Southern Hemisphere at the end of the last Ice Age strengthens the idea that warming and cooling occurs at alternate times in the two hemispheres. A more definitive answer to this debate will allow scientists to better predict when and how quickly the next climate shift will happen.</p>",

But an alternative view is that language evolved, in modern humans at least, to facilitate social bonding. It increased our ancestors’ chances of survival by enabling them to hunt more successfully or to cooperate more extensively.

Option C does this without deviating from the\ndiscussion.\nOption A: The evolution of language is not the focal point here; the views held in this regard are. {\"language has\nbeen continuously evolving to higher forms\"} Thus, we can eliminate this option since it comes across as a\nmisrepresentation.\nOption B: This is a trap wherein the statement captures both the core viewpoints but there is a distortion\ninvolved: \"...From the belief ...\" to \"...scholars now...\" indicates a shift in the viewpoint. However, this is not the\ncase - the author simply states two prevalent perspectives on the subject.\nOption D: is again a distortion since experts are not \"challenging any views; the author simply highlights the\npresence of two viewpoints {no conflict presented}\nHence, Option C is the correct answer.",

A record dates back to ancient Rome, when Antony met Cleopatra and his political enemy Octavian launched a smear campaign against him with “short, sharp slogans written upon coins.” The perpetrator became the first Roman Emperor and “fake news had allowed Octavian to hack the republican system once and for all”. But the 21st century has seen the weaponization of information on an unprecedented scale.

Option C effectively conveys the continuity of using misinformation for power throughout\nhistory, now fueled by modern technology. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.\nOption A: While the passage acknowledges the historical aspect of disinformation, it emphasizes the\nunprecedented scale in the 21st century, which is not captured in this option.\nOption B focuses on the need for critical reading without explicitly highlighting the historical context and the\nweaponization of information for power.\nOption D does not emphasize the broader historical and contemporary context of misinformation for political\npurposes.",

At first, scientists suspected birds were simply startled by the loud noise. But a new study suggests a more sophisticated mechanism: the caterpillar's whistle appears to mimic a bird alarm call, sending avian predators scrambling for cover. When pecked by a bird, the caterpillars whistle by compressing their bodies like an accordion and forcing air out through specialized holes in their sides. The whistles are impressively loud — they have been measured at over 80 dB from 5 cm away from the caterpillar — considering they are made by a two-inch long insect.</p>",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "According to the paragraph, the North American walnut sphinx moth caterpillars produce whistles which are\nextremely loud considering their size. These whistles appear to mimic bird(predator) alarm calls which scares\nthem to look for cover. Thus, these sounds act as acoustic deception and help the insect to defend themselves\nagainst predators.\nOption A mentions about vocal tracts which is out of scope. Hence, it can be eliminated.\nOption B though correct, fails to mention the use of sound to defend against the predators. Hence, it can be\neliminated.\nOption C captures all the main points and hence is right choice.\nOption D mentions 'camouflage' which is also out of context.

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1903, left-wing feminist Elizabeth Magie invented The Landlord’s Game, the original version of what became Monopoly. It was designed as a powerful teaching tool to illustrate the dangers of monopolies and how wealth could concentrate in the hands of a few. The game featured a circular path, properties, and a “Go to Jail” space. Magie created two rule sets: one “monopolist” version where players crushed opponents through accumulation, and another, more radical “Prosperity” version, where everyone shared in the wealth, promoting fairness and equity. Years later, unemployed Charles Darrow sold a simplified version to Parker Brothers. They paid Magie only $500 for her patent—without royalties—and credited Darrow as the sole inventor. For decades, his tale of inventing the game in his basement remained the official story, while Magie’s name and her original, anticapitalist message were left in the shadows.</p>",

Option (a) captures this essence\nbest because it highlights all the key elements together:(i) Magie’s left-wing feminist identity, (ii) the irony of her\nlosing credit, (iii) the role of Darrow in selling a version of the game, (iv) the small payment she received, and (v)\nthe denial of royalties.

Option (c) is incorrect because it\nrepeats the very myth the passage is trying to debunk by portraying Darrow as the true innovator.

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Zombie cells may contribute to age-related chronic inflammation: this finding could help scientists understand more about the aging process and why the immune system becomes less effective as we get older. Zombie or “senescent” cells are damaged cells that can no longer divide and grow like normal cells. Scientists think that these cells can contribute to chronic health problems when they accumulate in the body. In younger people, the immune system is more effective at clearing senescent cells from the body through a process called apoptosis, but as we age, this process becomes less efficient. As a result, there is an accumulation of senescent cells in different organs in the body, either through increased production or reduced clearance by the immune system. The zombie cells continue to use energy though they do not divide, and often secrete chemicals that cause inflammation, which if persistent for longer periods of time can damage healthy cells leading to chronic diseases.</p>",
      "options": [
        "Senescent “zombie” cells are inactive or malfunctioning cells that can be found throughout the body.",
        "A younger person's immune system is healthy and is able to clear the damaged cells, but as people age, the zombie cells resist apoptosis, and start accumulating in the body.",
        "Aging leads to less effective apoptosis, and therefore zombie cells start to accumulate in the body, causing inflammation, which accelerates aging and leads to chronic diseases.",
        "Dead cells accelerate chronic inflammation weakening the immune system and lead to aging."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The passage describes how ageing, a weaker immune system, and chronic disease are connected. It\nintroduces senescent or “zombie” cells, explains that younger people clear them more easily, and shows that\nthis process slows with age. As a result, these cells build up, causing ongoing inflammation and damage to\nhealthy tissue. Based on this, we consider each option individually.\nOption A is too limited. It correctly says that senescent cells are malfunctioning and present in the body, but it\nmisses the main point: as people age, these cells are not cleared as well, they build up, and this leads to\ninflammation.\nOption B points out the differences between younger and older immune systems and mentions apoptosis, but it\nwrongly states that zombie cells 'resist' apoptosis. The passage actually focuses on the immune system\nbecoming less effective, not the cells resisting. It also leaves out the important role of inflammation and\nchronic disease.\nOption C covers the whole chain described in the passage. It links ageing to less effective apoptosis, explains\nhow zombie cells build up, and includes their role in inflammation and chronic disease. This matches both the\nstructure and the focus of the original text.\nOption D is incorrect and somewhat out of the scope of the passage. The passage is about metabolically active\nsenescent cells, not dead cells, and it does not say that inflammation directly weakens the immune system as\nthis option suggests.\nSo, option C best sums up the main idea of the passage.",

      "question": "<p><strong>The passage given below is followed by four summaries. Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the dynamic realm of creativity, artists often find themselves at the crossroads between drawing inspiration from diverse cultures and inadvertently crossing into the territory of cultural appropriation. Inspiration is the lifeblood of creativity, driving artists to create works that resonate across borders. The globalized nature of the modern world invites artists to draw from a vast array of cultural influences. When approached respectfully, inspiration becomes a bridge, fostering understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity. However, the line between inspiration and cultural appropriation can be thin and easily blurred. Cultural appropriation occurs when elements from a particular culture are borrowed without proper understanding, respect, or acknowledgement. This leads to the commodification of sacred symbols, the reinforcement of stereotypes, and the erasure of the cultural context from which these elements originated. It's essential to recognize that the impact of cultural appropriation extends beyond the realm of artistic expression, influencing societal perceptions and perpetuating power imbalances.</p>",
      "options": [
        "Artists in a globalised world must navigate between drawing inspiration from diverse cultures respectfully and cultural appropriation that involves borrowing without proper acknowledgement which has broader societal impacts including perpetuating power imbalances.",

        "In a globalised world, artists must draw from diverse cultural influences to create works that appeal to all, and this results in instances of both inspiration and cultural appropriation.",
        "Artists must navigate the thin line between inspiration and cultural appropriation, where respectful inspiration fosters cultural understanding whereas appropriation involves borrowing without acknowledgement leading to commodification and reinforcement of stereotypes."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The passage talks about a key issue in modern art: a globalised world lets artists find inspiration in many\ncultures, but this also brings the risk of cultural appropriation. The author explains that respectful and\nthoughtful inspiration can help people appreciate other cultures. On the other hand, cultural appropriation is not\njust borrowing, but borrowing without understanding, respect, or acknowledgement, which can lead to\ncommodification, stereotypes, and bigger problems in society, like reinforcing power imbalances. Based on this,\nlet's consider each option individually.\nOption A clearly shows both sides of the argument. It mentions the global context, separates respectful\ninspiration from appropriation that lacks acknowledgement, and highlights the passage’s focus on bigger social\nissues like power imbalances. This matches the passage’s main points well.\nOption B points out the main difference between respectful inspiration and appropriation, but it is too general. It\ntreats the issue as just a matter of “deciding” and leaves out the effects of appropriation and its impact on\nsociety, which are key parts of the passage.\nOption C gets the author’s view wrong by suggesting that drawing from different cultures always “results in\ninstances of both inspiration and cultural appropriation.” The passage does not say this is inevitable. Instead, it\nsays appropriation depends on how the borrowing happens. Also, \"artists must draw from diverse cultural\ninfluences \" is a bit strong, and it is also not implied in the passage.\nOption D does a good job explaining the difference between inspiration and appropriation and talks about\ncommodification and stereotypes. However, it does not mention the global context or the idea of wider power\nimbalances, so it is a bit more limited in scope compared to the passage.\nOverall, option A is the best choice because it covers the global context, the ethical difference between\ninspiration and appropriation, and the wider social effects the author talks about.",

Choose the option that best captures the author's position.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For each of the past three years, temperatures have hit peaks not seen since the birth of meteorology, and probably not for more than 110,000 years. The amount of carbon dioxide in the air is at its highest level in 4 million years. This does not cause storms like Harvey — there have always been storms and hurricanes along the Gulf of Mexico — but it makes them wetter and more powerful. As the seas warm, they evaporate more easily and provide energy to storm fronts. As the air above them warms, it holds more water vapour. For every half a degree Celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. Scientists call this the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This means the skies fill more quickly and have more to dump. The storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20 cm as a result of more than 100 years of human- related global warming which has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater.</p>",
      "options": [
        "The storm Harvey is one of the regular, annual ones from the Gulf of Mexico; global warming and Harvey are unrelated phenomena.",

      "explanation": "Let us note down the important points in the given paragraph.\nGlobal warming does not cause storms but make them more powerful. Due to the increase in the temperature,\nthe air can absorb more moisture. This relationship (the change in the ability to absorb water with the increase\nin the temperature) is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\nLet us evaluate the options.\nThe author provides storm Harvey as an example to illustrate how increased temperatures can arm the storms\nwith more power. Harvey is not the central theme of the given paragraph. We can eliminate options A and D\nsince option D places much emphasis on storm Harvey and option A states that there is no relationship\nbetween the increase in temperature and the power of storms.\nOption B states that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation cannot predict the quantum of destruction that a storm\nmight cause. This point is totally out of context with respect to what that is being discussed in the paragraph.\nTherefore, we can eliminate option B as well.\nOption C precisely explains the mechanism through which global warming makes the modern storms more\ndestructive. Therefore, option C is the right answer.",

      "explanation": "The passage contrasts the personal, introspective nature of lyric poetry with Marxism's outward focus on\nsocietal change. At first glance, the characteristics of lyric poetry - being personal, small-scale, and\nidiosyncratic - seem incompatible with Marxism's demand for a transformative critique of an unjust society.\nHowever, the passage introduces a nuanced perspective within Marxist thought, which recognises lyric poetry\nas having an implicit critical and utopian function. Through its imaginative and alternative modes of perception,\nlyric poetry can challenge dominant ideologies and suggest a vision of resistance to oppression. Thus, while\nlyric poetry does not directly engage with large-scale social concerns, it can still align with Marxist ideals by\noffering subtle forms of critique and hope for change. Option C most effectively captures this idea.\nNone of the other choices present a valid interpretation of the passage. For instance, Option A oversimplifies\nthe issue by portraying lyric poetry as merely ‘utopian,” ignoring its critical and resistant potential as described\nin the passage. It misses the nuanced compatibility suggested between lyric poetry and Marxism. Option B\ninaccurately suggests that Marxism has “internal contradictions,” which is not the focus of the passage.\nSimilarly, Option D frames Marxism as dismissive of lyric poetry, ignoring the strand of Marxist thought that\nfinds value in poetry's alternative perspectives; this misrepresentation makes it a weaker summary.",

There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that “remembered” a wholly unreal past. There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.

In his book Psychopolitics, Han warns of the sophisticated use of targeted online content, enabling ‘influence to take place on a prereflexive level’. On our current trajectory, “freedom will prove to have been merely an interlude.” The fear is that the digital age has not liberated us but exposed us, by offering up our private lives to machine-learning algorithms that can process masses of personal and behavioural data.

Engineers obviously rely heavily on the discoveries of physicists, but an engineer's knowledge of the world is not the same as the physicist's knowledge. In fact, an engineer's know-how will often depend on physical theories that, from the point of view of pure physics, are false. There are some reasons for this. First, theories that are false in the purest and strictest sense are still sometimes very good approximations to the true ones, and often have the added virtue of being much easier to work with.
