      "passage": "<p>Neither Marx, nor Mill, nor Nietzsche find the present condition of society to be advantageous to human flourishing. For each, the present condition of human affairs reduces human beings to something less than fully human ... Marx explains this demise of human flourishing as 'alienation', Mill as; 'conformity', and Nietzsche as; 'slave morality'.</p>\n\n<p>Karl Marx suggests that man is a \"species-being, not only in that he practically and theoretically makes as his object his own species as well as that of things, but also in that as a present and living species he considers himself to be a universal and consequently free being\". Marx believes that humans become less than fully human when they are unable to own the object of his labour and no longer view that labour as a manifestation of his life. Marx defined this decline of human flourishing as 'alienation'. He proposed that mankind (as workers) have become detached from their labour and consequent products of that labour, suggesting that the labour exerted is used to gain wages. He argues that the labour is simply a representation of earnings, we are alienated from work, it is external to us rather than being a part of our nature. Therefore, we are not fulfilled by our work, just our desire to gain wages. He states that money has alienated us from the products of our labour since it \"reduces all human qualities to quantitative, interchangeable values devoid of any specific value\".</p>\n\n<p>Marx's theory of alienation could be considered similar to Fredrich Nietzsche's idea of slave morality. Nietzsche's view that humans have become something less than fully human due to their need to be oppressed can be compared to Marx's view that humans are no longer accepting their labour to be a manifestation of their lives. In Marx's case, the labour and need for a wage can be seen as the oppressor causing humans to disassociate themselves from work and the products made due to a feeling of labour being a means to an end. These theories differ from John Stuart Mill who suggested that it is society's willingness to conform as a whole, rather than the individual's need for financial and moral stability for the demise of human flourishing.</p>\n\n<p>Mill believed that there is a danger of conformity, suggesting that there is a risk of society becoming identical and monocultural. Aristotle agrees with this view, stating that conformity stifles genius, whereas non-conformity can promote individuality and excellence due to people discovering new ways of living that could benefit society.</p>",

        "highlight how Marx's alienation is conceptually the same as Nietzsche's slave morality in describing modern society",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The statement explains how alienation manifests in capitalistic society where labor becomes merely a means to earn wages, disconnecting workers from their work and its products.

      "passage": "<p>The relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability has been one of the most contentious debates in contemporary policy circles. Traditional economic models have long assumed that growth and environmental protection are mutually exclusive goals—that pursuing one necessarily comes at the expense of the other. This assumption has shaped decades of policy decisions, often resulting in environmental degradation being treated as an acceptable cost of economic progress.</p>\n\n<p>However, recent research has begun to challenge this conventional wisdom. The concept of \"green growth\" suggests that economic expansion and environmental stewardship can be complementary rather than contradictory. Proponents argue that investments in clean technology, renewable energy, and sustainable infrastructure can drive economic growth while simultaneously reducing environmental impact. They point to examples of countries that have managed to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions, at least partially.</p>\n\n<p>Critics of the green growth narrative remain skeptical. They argue that the evidence for absolute decoupling—where economic growth continues while environmental impact decreases in absolute terms—remains limited and often relies on accounting tricks such as outsourcing pollution-intensive production to other countries. Furthermore, they contend that the focus on green growth distracts from more fundamental questions about whether infinite growth is possible or desirable on a finite planet.</p>\n\n<p>The debate has significant implications for policy. If green growth is achievable, then policies can focus on redirecting economic activity toward sustainable sectors without requiring fundamental changes to consumption patterns or economic structures. If critics are correct, however, more radical transformations may be necessary, potentially including steady-state economics or even degrowth in wealthy nations.</p>",
